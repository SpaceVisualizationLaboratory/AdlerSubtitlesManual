	{"text": "At its peak, the star was visible during the day, and bright enough to read by at night. The guest star shone for about two years and then faded away, leaving people across the world to wonder what it meant.", "time":160},

	{"text": "In 1846 an Irish noble, the Earl of Rosse, observing from his telescope in Birr Castle, drew this picture of a faint deep sky object. He thought it looked like a crab - the name stuck.", "time":180},
	{"text": "It is known as the Crab Nebula. Nebula is the Latin word for cloud.", "time":195},
	{"text": "Today, a continuing drive to observe and discover led us to build the Hubble Space Telescope, through which we get this amazing view overhead.", "time":205},

	{"text": "Further observations using x-rays allow us to examine the heart of the nebula, seeing things we can't with visible light.

	{"text": "Supernovae are very important, without them we wouldn't have heavy elements, such as the copper and zinc in pennies, not to mention silver and gold.

For these reasons the colors are very different than the older photographic survey in the background. Observing the nebula in different wavelengths of light allows us to discover important clues to its internal structure.", "time":440},
	{"text": "The winds from hot young stars are shaping the nebula. In places carving out regions, and in other places pushing material together where it may collapse under its own gravity to form new stars.", "time":445},

	{"text": "There have been times when we observe things so in conflict with our expectations that we've needed to rethink our entire model of how the Universe works. When this happens the Universe as we understand it has almost always become bigger and more fantastic. ", "time":720},
	{"text": "On the plaza in front of the Adler stands a statue of Nicolaus Copernicus, a replica of the one in front of the Polish Academy of Sciences in Warsaw.  In the 1500s, Copernicus began one the greatest intellectual revolutions in history.", "time":750},
	{"text": "Before Copernicus, people believed that the Earth was the center of the Universe. After the Copernican Revolution, we understood that the Sun is the center of the solar system, and the Earth was just one of the planets orbiting it.", "time":765},
	{"text": "When Isaac Newton discovered his Universal Law of Gravitation in the late 1600s we understood why the planets orbited the Sun. We could even imagine planets orbiting other stars as well. This illustration, also a part of the Adler's collections, depicts this new worldview. Each star orbited by undiscovered worlds.", "time":780},
	{"text": "At that time we thought our Galaxy was the entire Universe, but in the 1920s when Edwin Hubble discovered that the objects he was observing were separate galaxies, far beyond the boundaries of our Milky Way, we began to appreciate just how truly large our Universe is. Today, our unwavering sense of wonder pushes us to build better and better telescopes, which further enable us to glimpse the immensity of the Universe.", "time":810},

	{"text": "Actually I lied, we are zooming in much farther - to a patch only the size of Lincoln's eye on a penny held at arm's length.", "time":867},
	{"text": "This image is known as the Hubble Extreme Deep Field. The image combines exposures taken over a decade and is equivalent to 23 continuous days of observation, allowing us to detect VERY faint objects. There are 5,500 galaxies in this tiny patch of Sky - the size of Lincoln's eye - and that means there are about 600 billion galaxies across the whole sky.(PAUSE  - let it sink in) And (don't forget) each of these galaxies has, on average, hundreds of billions of stars.", "time":905},
	{"text": "Some of the objects in this image, the small red ones, are among the most distant galaxies ever observed. Because it takes light many billions of years to reach us from these objects, we observe them as they were in the distant past. In this one image we can observe 95% of cosmic history, gathering information about how galaxies evolve over time.", "time":930},
	{"text": "With the unaided eye we can see thousands of stars. Telescopes allow us to view billions of galaxies. Yet for a long time we've wondered if there is more to the Universe than we can see. ", "time":970},
	{"text": "Now we are zooming into one of the most massive clusters of galaxies in the Universe - the Coma Cluster -”containing more than 1,000 galaxies.", "time":1110},
	{"text": "In the 1930s, astronomer Fritz Zwicky made a measurement of the speed of galaxies in this cluster. They are going very fast. So fast, in fact, that the galaxies should just fly apart. There isn't nearly enough matter in what we see to provide the gravity needed to bind the galaxies. Since the cluster remains intact, Zwicky surmised that there had to be matter we didn't see, DARK MATTER, holding the galaxies together.", "time":1130},
	{"text": "Forty years later Vera Rubin uncovered another piece in the puzzle, by observing the speeds that stars were moving inside Spiral galaxies.", "time":1160},
	{"text": "One of the galaxies she studied was our neighbor Andromeda. Not only did the speed of the stars indicate that there must be dark matter in the Andromeda Galaxy, but the dark matter had to extend well beyond its visible edge. Galaxies, it seemed were surrounded by large dark matter halos.", "time":1185},
	{"text": "This is often the way scientific discovery occurs - we observe something unexpected, wonder what might be the cause, and then build theories to explain what we have seen. Sometimes it happens the other way around our theories of the Universe predict things that we aren't able to observe until much later.", "time":1210},
	{"text": "In 1936 Einstein predicted that gravity from a very massive object would warp space. The light travelling through that region of space would be bent, just like light travelling through a lens. The effect wasn't observed until after his death, but today, gravitational lensing is helping us unlock further mysteries of the Universe, including the mystery of Dark Matter.", "time":1230},
	{"text": "Notice the bright yellow objects in the center, they are the cluster galaxies. The blue ones are are background galaxies whose images have been magnified, warped and distorted into arcs.", "time":1260},
	{"text": "Check this out! There are one, two, three, four and five images of the same background galaxy. Multiple images like this only occur when the gravitational field is very strong and the spacetime warping very intense.", "time":1277},
	{"text": "Seeing how the light is distorted allows us to figure out where the dark matter is.", "time":1300},
	{"text": "We are now showing a map of the Dark Matter in blue.", "time":1305},
	{"text": "Even though dark matter doesn't emit any light, and even though we've never detected it in the laboratory, gravitational lensing lets us map out dark matter on the sky. We have discovered a way to observe what we can't directly see.", "time":1315},
	{"text": "Dark Matter is just one of the many mysteries of the Universe that we are facing. Some of them will likely require the next generation of scientists to solve, perhaps someone in this very room.", "time":1330},
	{"text": "To better understand dark matter, we need to discover more gravitational lenses, and to do that I'm asking for your help. We've just started a project called Space Warps that harnesses the power of the crowd to sift through tremendous numbers of images and find new gravitational lenses. You can join this project at Zooniverse.org", "time":1305},
	{"text": "We've been on an amazing journey. Our observations are solid, our sense of wonder persists, and many discoveries are yet to be made.", "time":1360},
